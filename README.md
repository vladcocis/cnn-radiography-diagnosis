The final model has excellent performance on a large number of testing samples, includes features such as preprocessing and Grad-CAM visualization which reflect its fitness for purpose. It has achieved much more than the initial aims of the project while remaining in the same overall time frame. Build quality overall is high, with some weaknesses discovered during evaluation. In its current state, the project is proof that a computer-aided diagnosis tool for medical imaging is achievable. It is both reliable due to its high performance and robust due to the many image processing tools used to correct images and ensure wide compatibility.
With more time and work, the system could be improved greatly, facilitating its use by medical professionals. A graphical user interface coupled with a refined visualization of affected areas would be improvements that would turn this project into an invaluable tool for radiologists.
